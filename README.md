## **Project Title**
The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) task for Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. This is one of the four assignments for my course INFO659 Introduction to Data Analyticas. 

## **Getting Started**
### *Prerequisites*
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.

### *Installing*
1. Have R and Rstudio in your machine -- I'm using R Version 3.6.1
2. Install package corrplot for multivariate analysis.
3. Install package knitr and kableExtra for table formatting.

### *Notes*
1. Created another version in jupyter notebook with R codes since Github has no rendering for .nb.html files. This is an ongoing issue with Github.
2. Was not able to use knitr and kableExtra in jupyter.
