## **Credit Card Fraud Prediction**

This repo contains the following two tasks:
1. EDA for Credit Card Fraud Detection
2. Machine Learning Modeling

These studies were implemented in fulfillment of the requirements for the Data Analytics Course of Master of Science in Data Science (Fall Term 19-20) under Drexel University College of Computing & Informatics. 

To combat credit card fraud, machine learning can be used in the form of supervised learning to implement a model in R. This machine learning model will help us predict which transactions are fraudulent and which ones are not. 

## **Getting Started**
### *Prerequisites*
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.

### *Installing*
1. Have R and Rstudio in your machine -- I'm using R Version 3.6.1
2. Install package corrplot for multivariate analysis.
3. Install package knitr and kableExtra for table formatting.

### *Notes*
1. Created another version in jupyter notebook with R codes since Github has no rendering for .nb.html files. This is an ongoing issue with Github.
2. Was not able to use knitr and kableExtra in jupyter.
